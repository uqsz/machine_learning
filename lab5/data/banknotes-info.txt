% Context
% Will you be able to identify genuine and conterfeit banknotes, even if half of the data is conterfeit? Perfect for testing different outlier detection algorithms.
% Content
% The dataset includes information about the shape of the bill, as well as the label. It is made up of 200 banknotes in total, 100 for genuine/conterfeit each.
% Attributes:
% -conterfeit: Wether a banknote is conterfeit (1) or genuine (0)
% -Length: Length of bill (mm)
% -Left: Width of left edge (mm)
% -Right: Width of right edge (mm)
% -Bottom: Bottom margin width (mm)
% -Top: Top margin width (mm)
% -Diagonal: Length of diagonal (mm)

% Applications
% While it might be pretty easy for a classifier to decide wether the banknotes are conterfeit or not, what about methods using outlier detection?
% Classical methods of outlier detection won't work, since half of the data consist of outliers (conterfeit bills), so more robust methods will be needed.
